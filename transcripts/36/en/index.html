        <p>For the VimGolf challenge "List the first 100 prime numbers", there's a solution that uses a regular expression to detect prime numbers. At 43 keystokes, it's not the winning solution, but I think it's the most interesting one. It uses a few clever Vim tricks, including macros, control-a to increment, the very magic pattern switch, and the <code>:global</code> command. There's a lot to learn from those 43 keystrokes, so let's study it!</p>

<pre><code>C&lt;Tab&gt;1&lt;Esc&gt;
qw
&lt;C-a&gt;
&gt;&gt;
Yp
q
540@w
:g/\v^(&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;+)\1+&lt;/d|%s/&lt;Tab&gt;*
ZZ
</code></pre>

<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>Here's the general strategy: we'll start by inserting the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, up to 541, which is the one-hundredth prime number. Having inserted all of the numbers in this range, one per line, we'll then delete each line that contain a non-prime number. That should leave us with the first 100 prime numbers, and nothing else.</p>

<p>The global command will act as our sieve:</p>

<pre><code>:global/{pattern}/[cmd]
</code></pre>

<p>This lets us execute a specified Ex command on every line of the file that matches a particular pattern. In our case, we'll run the <code>delete</code> Ex command, for each line that contains a non-prime number:</p>

<pre><code>:global /{non-prime number}/ delete
</code></pre>

<p>For the golfers, note that both <code>global</code> and <code>delete</code> can be abbreviated to a single character:</p>

<pre><code>:g/{non-prime number}/d
</code></pre>

<p>Writing a pattern that matches non-prime numbers is the clever part. And here's the trick: we'll indent each line by a number of tabs that equals the value of the number on that line. For example, the line containing the number 2 will lead with 2 tab characters. The line containing the number 3 will lead with 3 tab characters. And so on.</p>

<h2 id="inserting-all-numbers-from-2-to-541">Inserting all numbers from 2 to 541</h2>

<p>Starting with a blank document, we'll begin by inserting a single tab, followed by the number 1.</p>

<pre><code>C&lt;Tab&gt;1&lt;Esc&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we'll start recording a macro into register <code>w</code>. The ctrl-a command increments the number on the line, then the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> "indent" command adds a tab at the start of the line. Finally, we'll duplicate the line, then stop recording the macro.</p>

<pre><code>qw
&lt;C-a&gt;
&gt;&gt;
Yp
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can execute our macro with a count of 540, which produces all of the numbers from 2 up to 542. It's difficult to see what's happening here, so let's make the tab character visible:</p>

<pre><code>:set list listchars=tab:▸\ ,eol:¬
</code></pre>

<p>And for the sake of clarity, we'll also set the width of a tab to a single column:</p>

<pre><code>:set tabstop=1
</code></pre>

<p>Now you should be able to see that the line containing the number 2 leads with two tab characters, the line containing the number 3 leads with three tab characters, and so on. The general appearance resembles a staircase, which wanders constantly to the right.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-all-non-prime-numbers">Deleting all non-prime numbers</h2>

<p>The next step is to delete all non-prime numbers. It can be done with this one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>:g/\v^(&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;+)\1+&lt;/d|%s/&lt;Tab&gt;*
</code></pre>

<p>Did you catch that?</p>

<p>There's a lot going on in that command, so let's undo that change and break it into chunks.</p>

<p>This regular expression does all of the hard work for us:</p>

<pre><code>/\v^(   +)\1+&lt;
:set hlsearch
</code></pre>

<p>If we search for it, and enable the <code>hlsearch</code> option, then we'll see each line containing a non-prime number light up. How does that work?</p>

<p>First of all, note that the pattern begins with <code>\v</code> - the very magic switch. Here's the same regular expression without it:</p>

<pre><code>/\v^\(   \+\)\1\+\&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>The very-magic switch allows us to use symbols such as parentheses, word delimiters and the plus symbol without having to escape them. That makes for a neater regular expression.</p>

<p>The less-than sign stands for the beginning of a word, or to put it another way: it stands for the end of the sequence of whitespace characters.</p>

<p>All of the magic happens in this bit in the middle. Inside the parentheses, we match two or more tab characters. These are captured in a sub-match, and we can reference this sub-match using the <code>\1</code> notation. This bit of the pattern matches one or more occurrences of the original sub-match.</p>

<p>So we have a pattern that refers to a fragment of itself. What does that mean? To understand, it helps to look at the mechanics of how a regular expression works. We'll run through two examples: first on a non-prime number, then on a prime number.</p>

<h3 id="matching-8-tab-characters">Matching 8 tab characters</h3>

<p>The <code>+</code> operator means "one or more" occurrences, and it performs a greedy match. That means it matches as many characters as it can. In this case, the sub-match expands to all eight tab characters.</p>

<p>But the backreference attempts to match the same range of text again. In this case, there are no more tab characters left, so we don't get a match.</p>

<p>When a greedy match fails, the regular expression engine makes another attempt using a slightly less greedy match. In this case, it attempts to match 7 characters (instead of 8). That creates a submatch of 7 characters, and once again we have no match.</p>

<p>This process continues. We get no match with 6 characters, or 5. When it gets down to 4 tabs, we score a match!</p>

<p>This indicates that the number 8 is divisible by 4, so it's not a prime number.</p>

<h3 id="attempting-to-match-7-tab-characters">Attempting to match 7 tab characters</h3>

<p>Now let's run through the same proceedure for the number 7 - a prime.</p>

<p>Once again, the regex engine starts by doing a greedy match, which consumes all available tab characters.</p>

<p>Then the first match contracts to 6 tabs, then 5, then 4, and so on. The regex engine doesn't attempt anything less than two, because that was hard coded in the regular expression.</p>

<p>We can conclude that there is no way of matching 7 tab characters with this pattern. Or in other words, 7 must be a prime number.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-prime-sieve-pattern-with-global">Using the prime-sieve pattern with :global</h3>

<p>This same proceedure works for every number in our document. With the search highlighting enabled, you can clearly see which numbers are non-primes. Each line that is highlighted will be deleted when we run the global command:</p>

<pre><code>:g/\v^(   +)\1+&lt;/d
</code></pre>

<p>And that leaves us with only the prime numbers.</p>

<h3 id="tidying-up">Tidying up</h3>

<p>As a final step, we want to flatten the indentation. We can do so using this substitute command:</p>

<pre><code>:%s/&lt;Tab&gt;*//
</code></pre>

<p>That matches every sequence of tabs, replacing each one with an empty string. The line numbers show that we have 100 lines, and we know that each one contains a prime number. So we're finished - we've inserted the first 100 primes!</p>

<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
