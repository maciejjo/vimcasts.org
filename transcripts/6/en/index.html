        <h1 id="buffers-and-hidden-buffers">Buffers and hidden buffers</h1>

<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>

<p>Here I have a directory with files named A, B, C, D and E. I'm going to launch
Vim in this directory with a wildcard as an argument. This tells Vim to load
each file in this directory ending in .txt into a buffer. To begin with, all you 
can see is the first of these files, but if I run the command:</p>

<pre><code>:ls
</code></pre>

<p>then you can see that each of the files has been loaded into a buffer. I can
easily scroll through the buffers by running:</p>

<pre><code>:bn[ext]
</code></pre>

<p>to view the next buffer, or:</p>

<pre><code>:bp[revious]
</code></pre>

<p>to view the previous buffer. Note that previous and next commands do cycle
between the first and last items in the buffer list.</p>

<p>Anytime that you run <code>:ls</code>, you get a list of the buffers. These include a few
annotations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>'a' marks an active buffer, meaning that it is currently loaded in a window</li>
  <li>'#' (the hash sign) marks the alternate buffer</li>
</ul>

<p>You can quickly jump between the active buffer and the alternate buffer using
the command: <code>ctrl-^</code>. Pressing it again takes you back to where you were
before. You can think of this as being a bit like the command-tab behaviour in
OS X (or alt-tab in linux and windows), which switches focus between the
currently active window, and the application you used most recently.</p>

<p>Now lets try making a change to file A, without saving it. If I run <code>:ls</code>
again, you should see a new symbol:</p>

<ul>
  <li>+ (the plus sign) indicates that a buffer has been modified, therefore its
contents differ from the corresponding file</li>
</ul>

<p>Having made this change, but not saved it, let's now try and switch to another
buffer with the <code>:bn</code> command. This raises an error:</p>

<p>E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)</p>

<p>At this point, I could do a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>save the file, and reissue the command to move on to the next buffer</li>
  <li>or follow the advice in the prompt, and run the command with a trailing
exclamation mark</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's try running <code>:bn!</code> (b-n-bang), as advised. OK, this brings us to the next buffer,
as expected. So lets see what happens now when I run <code>:ls</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>File A is still marked with a + (plus sign), indicating that the buffer has
been modified</li>
  <li>additionally, the file is marked with an 'h', which stands for hidden</li>
</ul>

<p>A buffer is marked as 'hidden' if it has unsaved changes, and it is not
currently loaded in a window. </p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-having-hidden-buffers">Consequences of having hidden buffers</h2>

<p>If you try and quit Vim while there are hidden buffers, an error will be 
raised:</p>

<p>E162: No write since last change for buffer "a.txt:</p>

<p>When you dismiss the error message, you'll find that the first hidden buffer
has been loaded into your current window. This gives you the opportunity
to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>save the changes to a file (<code>:w</code>)</li>
  <li>restore the original file (<code>:e!</code>)</li>
  <li>or forcibly remove the buffer from the buffer list (<code>:bd!</code>), discarding any
changes</li>
  <li>you can also force Vim to quit, discarding changes to all modified buffers
(<code>:q!</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, Vim makes it difficult for you to create a hidden buffer, but as 
long as you know how to deal with them when quitting Vim, there's nothing
wrong with creating them. To make Vim use hidden buffers more 
liberally, I include the following line in my .vimrc:</p>

<p>set hidden</p>

<p>With this setting applied, when I try to navigate away from a buffer with
unsaved changes, Vim will automatically hide it. Now, I can run the <code>:bn</code>
command, and it will switch to the next buffer without raising an error 
message.</p>
