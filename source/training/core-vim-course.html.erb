      I've taught my Core Vim Class to more than 600 people online and in person. Now, for the first time, I'm making available the core learning resources &ndash; the Vim Dojo and 10 videos &ndash; for purchase, so you can study Vim at your own pace, in your own time.

    <ul class="veryspaced">
      <li>by combining learning and doing through the videos and dojo you develop a deeper understanding of Core Vim principles</li>
      <li>By learning at your own pace you can take as much or as littel time as you need to get to grips with these vital Vim skills</li>
      <li>Over the course of study, I'll gradually tease out a set of best practices so you'll build a deeper knowledge of Vim rather than just assembling a list of quick-fix solutions</li>

    <h4>Watch the video</h4>
    <p>
      Each video introduces a problem that you're then encouragewd to try out in the Vim Dojo. Once you've had a go at solving the problem, you come back to the video, which will summarise as few possible approaches, comparing strengths and weaknesses. As the course unfolds, som patterns will emerge and I'll use these to derive a set of best-practices. There are ten videos in total, running from 5 to 15 minutes.

    <h4>Learn by doing</h4>
    <p>
      The Vim Dojo contains a set of 25 specially selected exercises that are designed to show you some best practices for using Vim. I believve that you learn best by doing, so the Vim dojo lets you get your hands dirty. I've specifically chosen exerciese that work together to gradyually built your knowledge of Vim and your confidence in your skills.

    If you believe in learning how to master tools you use every day in your job as a programmer, learn your editor inside and out. Drew's Vim master class is the gateway to becoming really proficient with Vim.

    <p>If you’ve already read <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>, then you may be familiar with the concepts covered in this class. The coursework doesn’t correspond to any single chapter of my book, but joins the dots between the most important tips.
