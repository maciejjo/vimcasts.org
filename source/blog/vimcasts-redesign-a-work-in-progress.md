In the not-too-distant future, you can expect to see a revised design for Vimcasts.org. The most significant enhancements will be the addition of tags, site search, and a responsive design for smaller screens. Hannah Adcock, from [contentedstrategy.com][], has been helping me out by analysing user feedback, as well as data from Google Analytics.

We recently put together a short survey asking for feedback on the Vimcasts.org site (if you filled it out, thanks!). The most popular suggestion for improvement was to categorise all screencasts and articles, to make it easier to find related content. Check Hannah's blog for [a detailed breakdown of the responses to our user survey][survey].

Hannah has also been digging into the data from my Google Analytics account. One of her discoveries was that visitors using mobile devices account for an above average rate of first-time visitors, as well as a higher bounce rate. We hope that by providing a responsive design, the site will be more welcoming to visitors using mobile devices. Hannah has also written [an analytics overview of Vimcasts.org][analytics], which tells a few more interesting stories with my data.

I'm currently migrating all Vimcasts content from Radiant CMS to Middleman, a static site generator. You can [follow my progress on github][gh]. There's a draft version of the site hosted on Github Pages. I won't link to here, but it's not hard to find if you're curious!
