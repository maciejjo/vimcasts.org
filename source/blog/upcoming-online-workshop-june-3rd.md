On Monday, June 3rd, I’m going to teach my [Core Vim Masterclass Online][class]. It will run for 4 hours, from 18:00 GMT. That’s 10:00 if you live in San Fransisco, or 13:00 if you live in New York. [Tickets cost £95][tickets] (approximately US $140), but there’s an £80 earlybird offer (approx. US $120) running until May 24th.
