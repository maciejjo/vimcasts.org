### [Edinburgh, July 2nd][ed]

The Edinburgh masterclass is kindly being hosted by [FreeAgent][]. It's on the Monday following the [Scottish Ruby Conference][src], so if you're in town for that, why not stick around for a day longer to improve your Vim-fu?

### [Glasgow, July 3rd][gl]

The Glasgow masterclass is being held at my alma mater, the University of Glasgow. Thanks to [@FionaN_A](http://twitter.com/FionaN_A) for helping me to book a room there.

### [Newcastle, July 9th][ne]

The Vim masterclass in Newcastle is being held at the [PostOffice][postoffice], thanks to [Paul Lancaster](http://twitter.com/lordlancaster). It's a great location - very central, and handy for public transport.

You can [purchase tickets from EventBrite][workshops]. The early bird price of Â£75 is available until 7pm on Friday, June 22nd (June 29th for the Newcastle workshops). After that, the price goes up to Â£90, so get in there fast!
