:title: Change of pricing for Core Vim Class
:date: 2013/09/26

---

I'm raising the price for my [online Core Vim Class][class] to Â£160.
From now on, attendees will receive an exclusive hour-long screencast that summarizes the material from the class.
The class itself covers similar material to before.

By buying a ticket for my Core Vim Class, you are supporting my work on Vimcasts. That means that I can produce more great content that is free for everybody. Thank you.

I love teaching this Core Vim Class and I plan to produce more Vim classes soon. Watch out for announcements.

If you're keen to attend a class, but can't afford it, [get in touch](mailto:drew@vimcasts.org). Perhaps we can trade in-kind.
