We discussed at length the Fugitive plugin by Tim Pope, and how it can be incorporated into your daily workflow with git. For more details, check out my [5 part series on the Fugitive plugin][series].

We also talked about how the [Github compare view][compare] can be used to tell the story of the evolution of a codebase. I've found that this makes for a great teaching reference, and is preferable to viewing snippets of code embedded in a blog post.

If you follow Vimcasts and use Git, then you should [check out the rest of the shows on GitMinutes][episodes]. The show features stories, discussions, ideas, demos and other things useful for those using Git today.
