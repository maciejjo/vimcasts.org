Fans of the [Plex media center][Plex] will be happy to know that there is now a [Vimcasts plugin][plugin], available from the Plex online app store. It was built by [Ches Martin][ches], who was inspired when he saw that there was a [Vimcasts plugin for Boxee][boxee]. So now you can get your fix of Vimcasts straight from your media center. Thanks Ches!
