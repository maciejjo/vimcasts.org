<p>I&#8217;m going to be taking a short break from Vimcasts to travel around India and Indonesia. I&#8217;ll be back in September, and a new season of Vimcasts will follow. If you&#8217;re eager to see more episodes, please show your support by leaving a tip - you can <a href="http://vimcasts.org/tipjar">donate with paypal</a>, or <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2010/07/vimcasts-adopts-flattr-for-micropayments/">flattr me</a>.</p>

<p>I will be available for contracting work from September. If you have any jobs involving ruby or javascript then <r:enkode_mailto email="andrew.jr.neil@gmail.com" link_text="drop me a line"/>. I&#8217;m happy to work remotely, or to travel if your part of the world appeals (to my wife).</p>

<p>Wish me good health!</p>
 
<p>Thanks,<br/>
Drew Neil</p>
