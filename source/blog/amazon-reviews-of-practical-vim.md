The first five-star [reviews for Practical Vim][reviews] have cropped up, and I'm blushing after reading them. It's been described as *the book Vim has always deserved*, and *a must-have for anybody who types*. Here are a few choice phrases:

> This is one of the best technical books I've ever read: comprehensive but never dry.
> [Peter][]

> If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. ...Satisfaction guaranteed.
> [iynaix][]

If you've read Practical Vim, please write a five-star review on Amazon. It makes a real difference. On the day that the first reviews were written, Practical Vim jumped from #16 to #2 on the [Amazon best-seller list for the Linux category][linux].

![Linux best sellers on Amazon, with Practical Vim at number 2](/images/blog/linux-best-sellers.png)

The number #1 spot is tantalizingly within reach. With your five-star review, we can get there! Here are a few more choice phrases:

> you can either read the book sequentially or a recipe at random; the content is so masterfully narrated that each recipe stands on its own.
> [Manoj][]

> For many, Vim is this daunting program; it seems almost impenetrable. Practical Vim disarms this mantra, taking a lighthearted approach that makes Vim seem completely unlike that hard, unfriendly editor we once considered it to be.
> [Mislav][]

> I thought I was pretty proficient at using Vim, but that assumption was completely shattered a few chapters into the book.
> [iynaix][]

> I now reach for [Practical Vim] as a reference instead of searching the web.
> [Mislav][]

> I sincerely wish there was a hard bound copy of this book; I am sure my paperback will wear out soon after reuse and re-reads.
> [Manoj][]

Thank you.
