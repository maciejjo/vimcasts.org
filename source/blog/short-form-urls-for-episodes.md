:title: Short form URLs for episodes
:date: 2010/04/01

Vimcasts.org now has it's own short form URLs. You can link to each episode by
number, using the form [`/e/10`][10] to link to episode 10. You can also link to the
episodes archive with the trailing path [`/e/a`][a].

These short form URLs are perfect for sharing on Twitter, and in other
situations where characters count. At the end of each screencast, I can now
include a short form URL so that you can easily find the corresponding show
notes for an episode.
