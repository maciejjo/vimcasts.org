:title: What to expect from a Vimcasts workshop
:date: 2012/02/24

You've already worked your way through the [Vimtutor][tutor], right? I've prepared a series of lessons that follow a similar format: plain text files containing simple problems, with instructions on how to complete them. The tasks are carefully designed to demonstrate tips and tricks that will boost your productivity. We'll work through them as a class, but you can take them at your own pace.

  The workshop learning materials are being developed in a private github repository. When you sign up for a Vimcasts workshop, you'll gain access to the repository. Don't worry if you don't have a github account - I can email you the necessary materials in time for the workshop.

  On the day, we'll be up and running with a minimum of fuss. Don't take my word for it. Kevin Miller attended my Austin workshop, and said:

The Vimcasts workshop won't teach you shallow VIM tricks - that you can find online. Instead Drew reveals epiphany after VIM epiphany. You'll learn how the visual, normal and ex mode intersect and how they can be tamed into doing your will. You'll leave the workshop with a pattern language for constructing elegant and robust text operations -- or magic if you prefer. Drew was an articulate teacher and he effortlessly illuminated subtle distinctions that had eluded me during a previous year of full time VIM usage. All in all well worth the time and money.

    I left the Vimcasts workshop thinking for the first time in my relationship with Vim that not only are there many ways of doing things in the one true editor, there might also be a right way.
