    <p>Vim's built-in abbreviation feature is handy if you want to auto-correct words that you frequently misspell, but it requires a lot of setup. The <code>:Abolish</code> command makes it easy to generate abbreviations that will correct multiple forms of the same word.</p>

<p><em>This is the final of a three-part series on Tim Popeâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish">abolish</a> plugin.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p>Vim's built-in <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/map.html#Abbreviations">abbreviations</a> feature can provide auto-correct functionality. For example, we could make Vim auto-correct 'colour' (the British spelling) to 'color' (the American spelling) by running this command:</p>

<pre><code>:iabbrev colour color
</code></pre>

<p>However, abbreviations are case sensitive, so if we wanted to trigger the auto-correction on 'Colour', we'd have to create another abbreviation. The same goes for 'COLOUR', as well as for 'colours', 'coloured', 'colouring', and so on.</p>

<p>The abolish plugin, by Tim Pope, provides a solution for this. It includes a smart command called <code>:Abolish</code>, which has a similar form to the built-in <code>iabbrev</code> command.</p>

<p>This single command:</p>

<pre><code>:Abolish {hon,col}our{,s,ed,ing} {}or{}
</code></pre>

<p>Generates all of these abbreviations in one go:</p>

<pre><code>:iabbrev  honours     honors
:iabbrev  honoured    honored
:iabbrev  HONOURS     HONORS
:iabbrev  Honoured    Honored
:iabbrev  HONOUR      HONOR
:iabbrev  honouring   honoring
:iabbrev  Honours     Honors
:iabbrev  honour      honor
:iabbrev  HONOURED    HONORED
:iabbrev  Honour      Honor
:iabbrev  HONOURING   HONORING
:iabbrev  Honouring   Honoring
:iabbrev  COLOURING   COLORING
:iabbrev  colouring   coloring
:iabbrev  COLOURED    COLORED
:iabbrev  Colouring   Coloring
:iabbrev  Coloured    Colored
:iabbrev  coloured    colored
:iabbrev  COLOURS     COLORS
:iabbrev  Colours     Colors
:iabbrev  colours     colors
:iabbrev  Colour      Color
:iabbrev  colour      color
:iabbrev  COLOUR      COLOR
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>:Abolish</code> command is really handy if you want to auto-correct the words that you frequently mis-spell. Check out <a href="https://github.com/tpope/tpope/blob/master/.vim/after/plugin/abolish.vim">Tim Pope's abbreviations</a> for ideas.</p>

<p>I've created an <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/vim-americanize">Americanize</a> plugin, which uses the <code>:Abolish</code> command to auto-"correct" lots of British words to their American equivalents.</p>
