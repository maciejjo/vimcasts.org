<h2 id="meet-vims-abbreviations">Meet Vim's abbreviations</h2>

<p>Vim has a built-in feature called <em>abbreviations</em>, which can provide autocorrect functionality. I frequently mistype the word 'the' as 'teh'. To correct this typo, we could create an abbreviation using the <code>iabbrev</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>:iabbrev teh the
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I type 'teh', it should automatically be changed to 'the' when I press space.</p>

<p>Actually, the abbreviation is triggered by any keystroke that ends the word, including punctuation marks and newlines:</p>

<pre><code>teh, teh&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The abbreviation is not triggered if the sequence of characters form the start of a longer word. For example, if I were to type the name of the capital city of Iran, the abbreviation won't kick in:</p>

<pre><code>tehran
</code></pre>

<p>In that sense, abbreviations are pretty smart. But they have their limits. If I happen to make this typo at the start of a sentence, the abbreviation won't kick in:</p>

<pre><code>Teh capital of Iran is Tehran.
</code></pre>

<p>Abbreviations are case sensitive, so if I wanted to be thorough I would have to define more than one such mapping for every word that I wanted to auto-correct.</p>

<pre><code>:iabbrev teh the
:iabbrev Teh The
:iabbrev TEH THE
</code></pre>

<p>The abolish plugin, by Tim Pope, provides a solution for this. It includes a smart command called <code>:Abolish</code>, which has a similar form to the built-in <code>iabbrev</code> command. </p>

<pre><code>:Abolish teh the
</code></pre>

<p>This single command generates these three different variations in one go. I'll source this file to execute that command. </p>

<p>We can inspect the list of abbreviations by running the command:</p>

<pre><code>:abbreviate
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we now have abbreviations that correct 3 case-variations of the same misspelling.</p>

<h2 id="patterns">Patterns</h2>

<p>Abolish can also define multiple abbreviations based on a list of comma-separated alternatives. Take the word <code>color</code>, for example. I tend to use the British spelling, but I'm often required to use the American spelling. So let's create an abbreviation for it:</p>

<pre><code>Abolish colour color
</code></pre>

<p>I'll source this file to execute that command, and now when I enter the British spelling of 'colour' it's changed to the American spelling. But the abbreviation doesn't apply when I write 'colours', 'coloured', or 'colouring', and so on.</p>

<p>We can tack these suffixes on at the end of the word, as a comma-separated list within a pair of braces. We could spell out the same list of suffixes on the right-hand side too, but an empty pair of braces has the same effect:</p>

<pre><code>:Abolish colour{,s,ed,ing} color{}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's source the file again. Now Vim will auto-correct all of the variations of the word <code>colour</code> that we specified. Here's the full list of abbreviations:</p>

<pre><code>:abbreviate
</code></pre>

<p>The word 'honour' follows a similar pattern. The British spelling includes the letter 'u', whereas the American spelling does not. We could adapt our command to generate abbreviations for honor as well as color:</p>

<pre><code>:Abolish {col,hon}our{,s,ed,ing} {}or{}
</code></pre>

<p>Source the file, and now look at our list of abbreviations. It's huge! We generated all of that from these two commands.</p>

<p>The Abolish command is really handy if you want to auto-correct the words that you frequently mis-spell. I've put together a plugin that generates abbreviations for converting lots of British spellings to the American equivalents. I'd be interested to hear of any other uses that you find for this feature.</p>
