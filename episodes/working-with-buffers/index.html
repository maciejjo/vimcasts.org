    <p>Introducing the buffer list, and commands for switching between buffers. This episode also covers the concept of 'hidden' buffers, and shows how to deal with them.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-buffers">Working with buffers</h3>

<p>These commands show and navigate through the buffer list:</p>

<table>
   <tr>
       <th>command</th>
       <th>action</th>
   <tr>
   <tr>
       <td><code>:ls</code></td>
       <td>show the buffer list</td>
   <tr>
   <tr>
       <td><code>:bn</code></td>
       <td>open the next buffer in the current window (cycles from the end of
       the list to the beginning).</td>
   <tr>
   <tr>
       <td><code>:bp</code></td>
       <td>open the previous buffer in the current window (cycles from the start of
       the list to the end).</td>
   <tr>
   <tr>
       <td><code>CTRL-^</code></td>
       <td>switch to the alternate file</td>
   <tr>


###Dealing with hidden buffers

A buffer is marked as 'hidden' if it has unsaved changes, and it is not
currently loaded in a window. 

If you try and quit Vim while there are hidden buffers, you will raise an
error: *E162: No write since last change for buffer "a.txt"*.

In this scenario, you can do any of the following:


<table>
   <tr>
       <th>command</th>
       <th>action</th>
   <tr>
   <tr>
       <td><code>:w</code></td>
       <td>save the changes to a file</td>
   <tr>

   <tr>
       <td><code>:e!</code></td>
       <td>restore the original file</td>
   <tr>
   <tr>
       <td><code>:bd!</code></td>
       <td>forcibly remove the buffer from the buffer list, discarding any changes</td>
   <tr>
   <tr>
       <td><code>:q!</code></td>
       <td>force Vim to quit, discarding changes to all modified buffers</td>
   <tr>


By default, Vim makes it difficult to create hidden buffers. To make Vim more liberal about hidden buffers, put the following in your .vimrc:

    set hidden
