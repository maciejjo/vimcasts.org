    <p>The undo command is almost universally available in software today. Being able to rollback unwanted changes can be a real timesaver. In most applications you can only go backwards and forwards linearly, but Vim keeps your changes in a tree structure, which means that you can retrieve edits from distant branches in your history. This episode will show you how.</p>

    <p>There are times when you can improve the readability of your code by lining up the elements on neighbouring lines. In this episode, I demonstrate how this can be achieved using the <a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabular</a> plugin.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-11-21">Nov 21, 2010</time>

    <p>When you need to build a complex command, or devise a non-trivial search pattern, Vim's command-line mode can be rather limiting. In this episode, I will introduce the command-line window, which allows you to use the full power of Vim when editing search queries and commands.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-10-12">Oct 12, 2010</time>

    <p>If you use Vim on muliple machines, it can be difficult to keep your configuration files synchronized across them. One solution is to put your dotfiles under version control. In this episode, I demonstrate how to keep your vimrc and plugins synchronized using git submodules and the pathogen plugin.</p>

    <p>TextMate has a few built in commands for moving selected text around a document. The end end result of using these commands can be achieved by cutting and pasting, but the visual feedback they provide is quite helpful. In this episode, I will show how to replicate these commands in Vim.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-09-28">Sep 28, 2010</time>

    <p>Choosing a colorscheme that you find pleasing to look at is essential if you want to be comfortable working with Vim. There are hundreds of colorschemes available, but what if you can't find one that you like? In this episode, I'll share a few tips that make it easy to create colorschemes for Vim.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-07-18">Jul 18, 2010</time>

    <p>The vimrc file allows you to preserve your settings so that they are restored each time you launch Vim. But what if you want to update your vimrc file in the middle of an editing session? This episode demonstrates a couple of tricks that make it easy to customize Vim on the fly.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-07-08">Jul 08, 2010</time>

    <p>HAML and ERB are two commonly used ruby templating languages. You may have a strong preference for one or the other, but it's not always up to you which one you use. I was recently asked to convert several HAML files to ERB format. In this episode, I will demonstrate a couple of Vim macros that helped make short work of the task. </p>

    <p>If you want to edit several adjacent lines with a similar format, you might save a lot of time by making a columnar selection. This episode will demonstrate how to achieve this using Vim's visual block mode.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-06-02">Jun 02, 2010</time>

    <p>Recording your keystrokes as a macro can be a great timesaver, but you have to be careful that you use commands in such a way that they can be reused. In this episode, I construct a fairly complex macro to build a structural HTML document from markdown.</p>
