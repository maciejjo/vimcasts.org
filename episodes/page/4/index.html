    <p>The fugitive plugin provides an interactive status window, where you can easily stage and review your changes for the next commit. The <code>:Gdiff</code> command visualizes the changes made to a file, by comparing the working copy with the index. In this episode, we'll learn how to stage hunks of changes to the index without using the <code>git add --patch</code> command.</p>

<p><em>This is the second of a five part series on fugitive.vim. In the next episode, we'll learn how to resolve a git merge conflict by performing a 3-way vimdiff.</em></p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">The fugitive plugin</a>, by Tim Pope, is a git wrapper for Vim. It  complements the command line interface to git, but doesn't aim to replace it. In this episode, we'll see how some of fugitive's commands can streamline your workflow.</p>

    <time datetime="2011-02-23">Feb 23, 2011</time>

    <p>The undo command is almost universally available in software today. Being able to rollback unwanted changes can be a real timesaver. In most applications you can only go backwards and forwards linearly, but Vim keeps your changes in a tree structure, which means that you can retrieve edits from distant branches in your history. This episode will show you how.</p>

    <p>There are times when you can improve the readability of your code by lining up the elements on neighbouring lines. In this episode, I demonstrate how this can be achieved using the <a href="https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular">Tabular</a> plugin.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-11-21">Nov 21, 2010</time>

    <p>When you need to build a complex command, or devise a non-trivial search pattern, Vim's command-line mode can be rather limiting. In this episode, I will introduce the command-line window, which allows you to use the full power of Vim when editing search queries and commands.</p>

    <p>If you use Vim on muliple machines, it can be difficult to keep your configuration files synchronized across them. One solution is to put your dotfiles under version control. In this episode, I demonstrate how to keep your vimrc and plugins synchronized using git submodules and the pathogen plugin.</p>

    <p>TextMate has a few built in commands for moving selected text around a document. The end end result of using these commands can be achieved by cutting and pasting, but the visual feedback they provide is quite helpful. In this episode, I will show how to replicate these commands in Vim.</p>

    <p>Choosing a colorscheme that you find pleasing to look at is essential if you want to be comfortable working with Vim. There are hundreds of colorschemes available, but what if you can't find one that you like? In this episode, I'll share a few tips that make it easy to create colorschemes for Vim.</p>

    <p>The vimrc file allows you to preserve your settings so that they are restored each time you launch Vim. But what if you want to update your vimrc file in the middle of an editing session? This episode demonstrates a couple of tricks that make it easy to customize Vim on the fly.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-07-08">Jul 08, 2010</time>

    <p>HAML and ERB are two commonly used ruby templating languages. You may have a strong preference for one or the other, but it's not always up to you which one you use. I was recently asked to convert several HAML files to ERB format. In this episode, I will demonstrate a couple of Vim macros that helped make short work of the task. </p>
