    <p>When writing code, we can often save time by duplicating a line then changing one or two parts of that line to make it suit our purposes. In this episode, we'll compare a few techniques for duplicating lines, and we'll see that the <code>:copy</code> Ex command is well suited to this task.</p>

    <p>Vim users are unforgiving of plugins that impair performance. Luckily, Vim provides built-in profiling tools that make it easy to diagnose performance issues. We'll start by looking at how to profile the vimrc file, then move on to a real world scenario where profiling helped to identify and aleviate a performance bottleneck.</p>

    <time datetime="2012-11-26">Nov 26, 2012</time>

    <p>With a little bit of Vimscript, you can create a custom folding expression for any filetype. We'll start by looking at the mechanics of folding with markers, then go on to create a folding expression for markdown documents.</p>

    <time datetime="2012-11-19">Nov 19, 2012</time>

    <p>Vim's folding feature enables us to expand and collapse regions of a document. Not only does this allow us to organize our workspace, it also makes it easy to navigate around the document, and to rearrange entire sections as though they were single lines.</p>

    <p>For the VimGolf challenge <a href="http://vimgolf.com/challenges/4d1c27940e3d7832db000010">"List the first 100 prime numbers"</a>, there's a solution that uses a regular expression to detect prime numbers. At 43 keystokes, it's not the winning solution, but I think it's the most interesting one. It uses a few clever Vim tricks, including macros, control-a to increment, the very magic pattern switch, and the <code>:global</code> command. There's a lot to learn from those 43 keystrokes, so let's study it!</p>

    <p>Git provides tools for searching the contents of files, commit messages, and even whether text was added or removed by a commit. In this episode, we'll see how fugitive's <code>Ggrep</code> and <code>Glog</code> commands wrap this functionality up so that we can search the contents and history of a git repo from right inside of Vim.</p>

    <time datetime="2011-05-13">May 13, 2011</time>

    <p>With the fugitive plugin, you're not limited to just working with files in your working tree. The <code>:Gedit</code> command allows you to open files in other branches, and to browse any <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/1_the_git_object_model.html">git object</a>, including tags, commits and trees. Plus, if your repository is hosted on github, you can easily bring up the webpage for any git object using the <code>:Gbrowse</code> command.</p>

    <time datetime="2011-05-06">May 06, 2011</time>

    <p>When git branches are merged, there is always the chance of a conflict arising if a file was modified in both the target and merge branches. You can resolve merge conflicts using a combination of fugitive's <code>:Gdiff</code> command, and Vim's built in <code>diffget</code> and <code>diffput</code>. In this episode, we'll find out how.</p>

<p><em>This is the third in a five part series on fugitive.vim.</em></p>

    <time datetime="2011-04-29">Apr 29, 2011</time>

    <p>The fugitive plugin provides an interactive status window, where you can easily stage and review your changes for the next commit. The <code>:Gdiff</code> command visualizes the changes made to a file, by comparing the working copy with the index. In this episode, we'll learn how to stage hunks of changes to the index without using the <code>git add --patch</code> command.</p>

<p><em>This is the second of a five part series on fugitive.vim. In the next episode, we'll learn how to resolve a git merge conflict by performing a 3-way vimdiff.</em></p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">The fugitive plugin</a>, by Tim Pope, is a git wrapper for Vim. It  complements the command line interface to git, but doesn't aim to replace it. In this episode, we'll see how some of fugitive's commands can streamline your workflow.</p>
