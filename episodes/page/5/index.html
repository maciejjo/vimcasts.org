    <p>If you want to edit several adjacent lines with a similar format, you might save a lot of time by making a columnar selection. This episode will demonstrate how to achieve this using Vim's visual block mode.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-06-02">Jun 02, 2010</time>

    <p>Recording your keystrokes as a macro can be a great timesaver, but you have to be careful that you use commands in such a way that they can be reused. In this episode, I construct a fairly complex macro to build a structural HTML document from markdown.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-05-16">May 16, 2010</time>

    <p>If you work with ruby you will know that the interactive ruby shell, or 'IRB' for short, is a useful sketchpad for coding. But the command line interface of IRB can feel quite limiting in comparison with the power of your text editor. In this episode, I'm going to demonstrate how you can get the best of both worlds, by loading Vim from inside IRB.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-05-10">May 10, 2010</time>

    <p>Using a spell checker is a good habit to get into.  In this episode, I demonstrate how to use Vim's built in spell checking feature.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-05-03">May 03, 2010</time>

    <p>'Do one thing and do it well' is the principle of the Unix toolkit. Editing text is a broad domain, and there are many related tasks with which it overlaps. Vim acknowledges this by enabling certain tasks to be outsourced to external programs which do that one thing, and do it well. This episode will demonstrate how the <em>par</em> program can be used for formatting text.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-04-26">Apr 26, 2010</time>

    <p>It is sometimes preferable to format text with hard wrapped lines, for example when writing emails in plaintext. Vim can apply this style of formatting for you. This episode shows some of the options which allow you to customize Vim's text formatting.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-04-20">Apr 20, 2010</time>

    <p>Long lines of text can be wrapped if they don't fit inside the window. By default, Vim will happily split in the middle of a word. This episode demonstrates how to use the 'linebreak' option to make Vim break lines without breaking words.</p>

    <p>This episode demonstrates how Vim's native file browser can be used to explore and manipulate the file system. </p>

    <p>This episode focuses on the <code>:edit</code> command. I demonstrate how to open files whose location is relative to the current working directory, then I show how to create a mapping which makes it easier to open files in the same directory as the one in the active window.</p>
