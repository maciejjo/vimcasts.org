    <p>Vimcasts was launched four years ago, in January 2010. I anticipated making only a dozen screencasts, but there are now over 50, as well as a blog. I'm going to make some changes so you can find what you're looking for more easily. I'd appreciate your...</p>

    <time datetime="2013-11-25">Nov 25, 2013</time>

    <p>To the newcomer, Vim's way of doing things may seem strange, but with familiarity it becomes natural. Many of Vim's features seemed odd to me at first, but when I got used to them I recognised that they had their own particular elegance. However, there's one feature of Vim that still feels awkward to me: using registers for copy and paste. The deeper my understanding of registers becomes, the more they frustrate me!</p>

I think that this is one area where Vim is especially confusing, partly because of <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/meet-the-yank-register#vim-jargon">Vim's non-standard jargon for cut, copy and paste operations</a>. It's not the most intuitive copy/paste system, but it's usable when you get the hang of certain concepts and techniques.</p>

    <time datetime="2013-11-13">Nov 13, 2013</time>

    <p>Many systems ship with a version of Vim that was compiled with the <code>-clipboard</code> feature disabled, which is a damned nuisance! Being able to <a href="http://vimcasts.org/e/58">access the system clipboard from Vim</a> is an essential feature. Let's look at a few ways of getting the <code>+clipboard</code> feature on OS X and Ubuntu.</p>
