    <p>I'm planning to take my Vim Masterclass workshop on tour around Europe and the USA this Summer. If you would like to bring a Vimcasts workshop to your town, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop">sign up with your email address and location</a>. If there's enough interest, I'll try and schedule something where you live.</p>

<p>I'm going to need help. Can you recommend a suitable venue in your town? Are there any local meetups or user groups that might be interested in a Vim workshop? If you can host an event, or help me connect with the right audience, then I would love to hear from you. Please get in touch with drew@vimcasts.org.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="let-me-know-where-i-should-run-a-workshop">Let me know where I should run a workshop</h3>

<p>I'll be making plans over the coming weeks. If you want to see a workshop in your town, <strong>now is the time</strong> to say so. I'm using <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop">wantworkshop.com</a> to guage interest in each location. You'll receive announcements by email first, before they reach the blog and twitter.</p>

<p>Each sign up counts as a vote, so get your peers and coworkers to sign up too. It takes 10 votes to unlock your city, which doesn't guarantee that I'll run a workshop there, but I'll do my best to accomodate it. A couple of days ago, I didn't know where <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/uk-bristol">Bristol</a> and <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/us-boston">Boston</a> were on the map, but now I'm considering running workshops in both cities!</p>

<p>Cast your votes, please!</p>

<h3 id="preliminary-schedule">Preliminary schedule</h3>

<p>I'm currently working hard to complete my book, <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>. I hope to be finished by the end of this month. In June, I'll run workshops in <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/pl-krakow">Krakow</a> and Berlin. In July, I plan to run a few workshops around Europe. So far, likely destinations include <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/nl-amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/fr-paris">Paris</a>, and <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/sp-barcelona">Barcelona</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to spend August and September travelling around the USA. Likely destinations there include <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/us-san_francisco">San Fransisco</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/us-los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/us-new-york">New York</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/us-chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/us-boston">Boston</a>. I'll also be running a workshop with Bill Odom at <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/vim-masterclass">the StrangeLoop conference</a> in St Louis.</p>

<p>I'll return to the UK in October. Likely destinations include <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/uk-bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/uk-glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/uk-edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/uk-newcastle_upon_tyne">Newcastle</a>, and <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/uk-london">London</a> (again).</p>

<p>If you can help me to make any of these workshops happen, I'd love to hear from you. Drop me an email on drew at vimcasts dot org.</p>
