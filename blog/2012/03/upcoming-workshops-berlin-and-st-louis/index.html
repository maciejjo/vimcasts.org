    <p>I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be running a <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/vim-masterclass">Vim masterclass at Strange Loop</a>, in September this year. The conference has a <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions">stellar lineup</a>, so I'm looking forward to it eagerly. I hope to see you there.</p>

<p>Closer to home (for me anyway), I'll also be running a <a href="http://vimcasts.eventbrite.com">Vim Masterclass in Berlin</a> on April 20th, at LAUNCH/CO.</p>

<p>Read about <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2012/02/what-to-expect-from-a-vimcasts-workshop/">what to expect from a Vim Masterclass</a> if you'd like to know more about the format of my workshops.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="berlin-april-20th">Berlin, April 20th</h3>

<p>Tickets for the Berlin workshops are available here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://berlin-vimcasts-am-1.eventbrite.com/?discount=earlybird">Morning session</a> (9.30am-12.30)</li>
  <li><a href="http://berlin-vimcasts-pm-1.eventbrite.com/?discount=earlybird">Afternoon session</a> (2-5pm)</li>
</ul>

<p>The early bird price of £75 (â‚¬90) is available until 6pm on Friday, April 6th. After that, the price goes up to £90 (â‚¬108), so get in there fast! Eight tickets are available for each session. I'm happy to offer a further discount to the morning session for students. Get in touch if you'd like to know more.</p>

<p>My book, Practical Vim, is set to be released as a Beta Book in mid-April. I'll be in a mood to celebrate, so please join me for drinks in Friedrichshain after the workshops.</p>

<p>Sadly, the date for my Berlin Vim Masterclass clashes with the <a href="http://railsberry.com/">railsberry</a> conference (my bad). If you want to do both, don't worry about it. I live in Berlin now, so it's easy enough for me to arrange another workshop here. If you want it to happen, sign up to <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop/locations/gm-berlin">bring another workshop to Berlin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="st-louis-september-23rd">St Louis, September 23rd</h3>

<p>Tickets for the Strange Loop Vim Masterclass are handled by the conference. First, you must <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/attendees/register-page">register for Strange Loop</a>, then pay an additional $100 to attend my workshop.</p>

<p>I'm planning to spend a month or so in the US, touring with my Vim Workshops. If you'd like to attend one, sign up to <a href="http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/vimcasts_workshop">bring a workshop to your city</a>. So far, it looks as though I'll be making a stop in San Fransisco, New York City, and Seattle. I'd love to do more, so let me know where to make it happen.</p>
