        <p>On Wednesday, November 28th, I'm going to teach my <a href="http://vimcasts-online-1.eventbrite.com/">Vim Masterclass online</a>. It will run for 3.5 hours, from <a href="http://everytimezone.com/#2012-11-28,300,6be">17:00 GMT</a>. That's 09:00 if you live in San Fransisco, or 12:00 if you live in New York. Tickets cost £95 (approximately US $150), but there's an £80 earlybird offer (approx. US $127) running until November 21st.</p>

<p>This is a World Premiere! I've run my Vim masterclass over 20 times in meatspace, but never before in cyberspace. I hope that this will be the first of many.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>I teach this class using a combination of slides and live coding. I'll broadcast a live stream of my screen and voice using Adobe Connect. We'll use a text chat room to communicate together as a class. You can ask questions at any time, and I'll pause at the end of each section to answer them.</p>

<p>When you sign up for the masterclass, I'll ask for your github username. The learning materials are in a private github repository, to which you'll be granted access. We'll work through a series of exercises that are designed to teach Vim best practices. I provide a PDF 'handout' which summarizes all of the material covered in the masterclass.</p>

<p>We have 3 hours of material to get through, but I've allocated 3.5 hours so that we can take a couple of breaks.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-the-only-viable-way-i-can-teach-in-the-us">This is the only viable way I can teach in the US</h2>

<p>I had hoped to take this workshop on <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2012/05/on-tour-this-summer-vim-masterclass-workshop/">tour around the US this Summer</a>, but I had to <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2012/08/status-of-us-tour/">cancel</a> those plans when I realized how difficult it would be to obtain the correct visa. That was disappointing. This workshop is much in demand in the US, so I hope that this solution will satisfy.</p>

<p>If I'm targeting the US market with this workshop, you might be wondering: why charge for tickets in British pounds? Good question! EventBrite lets me set the price in Euros, Dollars or Pounds, but they can only transfer funds into a bank account of the same currency. My bank is based in the UK, so it would be awkward for me to receive US Dollars. The situation isn't ideal, and I'm working on fixing it, but it's what I'm stuck with for now.</p>

<h2 id="join-me-for-a-free-preview-lesson">Join me for a free preview lesson</h2>

<p>I've never taught a class of this size in this format before, and I expect to make mistakes the first time. So I'm going to run <a href="http://vimcasts-online-0.eventbrite.com/">a free 1 hour class</a> a week before the main event. I'll go through 20-30 minutes of prepared material, and spend the rest of the time answering your questions. You're doing me a favour by attending. Thank you!</p>
