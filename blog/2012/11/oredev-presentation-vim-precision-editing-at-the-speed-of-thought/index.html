    <p>Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://oredev.org/">Ã˜redev</a>, in Sweden. Video from my session, <a href="https://vimeo.com/53144573">Vim - Precision editing at the speed of thought</a> can be found on Vimeo. You can view <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/nelstrom/vim-precision-editing-at-the-speed-of-thought">the slides from my talk</a> on speakerdeck. Here's the synopsis from my talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vim's modal editing model was conceived to meet the constraints of computing in the 1970s. The arrival of the mouse made intuitive point-and-click user interfaces the norm. While this was a boon for the novice computer user, it was a backward step for the power user. For a touch typist, there is no quicker way of editing text than with the keyboard.</p>

  <p>This session won't teach you much in the way of practical hands-on advice - for that, see my <a href="http://oredev.org/2012/sessions/vim-masterclass">Vim masterclass</a>. Instead, it will challenge your preconceptions about Vim, and inspire you to give it a second look. We'll draw analogies with the mechanics of video games such as Quake and Street Fighter II. We'll look at patterns in the game of chess, and see how they relate to the task of editing text. And we'll learn what Vim users have in common with Scrabble players.</p>

<p>You should check out the rest of the <a href="http://oredev.org/2012/videos">sessions from Ã˜redev 2012</a> too. Great stuff!</p>

<p>I'd like to say a warm thank you to the team behind Ã˜redev for making my stay in MalmÃ¶ so comfortable. I don't think I've ever felt so well looked after at a conference. If you have the chance to attend Ã˜redev next year, grab it!</p>

<p>Also, thanks to Anders Janmyr for inviting me to Ã˜redev.</p>
