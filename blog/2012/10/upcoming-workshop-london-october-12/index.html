    <p>Once again, I'm happy to announce that I'll be running a <a href="http://london-vimcasts-eve-2.eventbrite.com/">Vim Masterclass in London</a> on October 31st, at <a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/venue">Forward</a>. You can <a href="http://london-vimcasts-eve-2.eventbrite.com/">purchase tickets from EventBrite</a>. The early bird price of £85 is available until 7pm on Wednesday, October 24th. After that, the price goes up to £100, so get in there fast!</p>

<p>This could become a regular thing, now that I'm living in London.</p>
