    <p>I'll be running a <a href="http://bristol-vimcasts-eve.eventbrite.com/">Vim Masterclass in Bristol</a> on October 24th, at <a href="http://wearebeef.co.uk/">Beef</a>.</p>

<p>Read about <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2012/02/what-to-expect-from-a-vimcasts-workshop/">what to expect from a Vim Masterclass</a> if you'd like to know more about the format of my workshops.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The early bird price of £85 is available until 7pm on Wednesday, October 17th. After that, the price goes up to £100, so get in there fast! Only eight tickets are available for this session. If there's enough demand, then I'll consider running a second workshop that same week, either on the Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
