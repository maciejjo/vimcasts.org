    <p>Thanks to the awesome folk behind <a href="http://wrocloverb.com/">wroc_love.rb</a>, I'll be running a couple of <a href="http://vimcasts.eventbrite.com/">Vim workshops</a> in Wroclaw, Poland. They will take place on the 9th of March; one in <a href="http://wroclaw-vimcasts-am.eventbrite.com/">the morning</a>, and one in <a href="http://wroclaw-vimcasts-pm.eventbrite.com/">the afternoon</a>. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://blog.wrocloverb.com/post/17322745303/vim-workshop">20% discount</a> is available for anyone attending the wroc_love.rb conference.</p>

<p>What can you expect from a Vimcasts workshop? Dirty hands. We learn best by doing, so I won’t lecture you. Instead, we’ll work through excercises designed to reveal the best practices of working with Vim. The material will tie in with my upcoming book, <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2010/11/working-title-practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>.</p>

<h2 id="future-dates-for-workshops">Future dates for workshops</h2>

<p>I'll soon be announcing dates for workshops in Berlin and Krakow. If you'd like to bring it closer to home, make sure you <a href="http://eepurl.com/geHtT">sign up for a Vimcasts workshop in your town</a>. Let me know where you live, and if there's enough interest for your town I'll add it to my agenda. I plan to run more workshops throughout Europe in the first half of 2012, and in the US in the second half of the year.</p>
