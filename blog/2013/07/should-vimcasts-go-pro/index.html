    <p>I've just published <a href="http://vimcasts.org/e/50">episode 50 of Vimcasts</a>. That feels like a significant milestone and a good time to consider the question: what's next?</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Would you like to pay a subscription for more Vimcasts?</strong> Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yDt5vHypWC_sZEWyjyaSFSgxifZdZyOgOieEgru38WQ/viewform">fill out this short survey</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Each episode of Vimcasts takes many hours of research and development. I have to prioritise other projects that pay the rent, especially now that I'm supporting my wife through her post-graduate studies. I'm finding it increasingly hard to make time for making Vimcasts.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of years, I've paid to subscribe to several video series, including <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All Software</a> by Gary Bernhardt, <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a> by Ryan Bates, and <a href="http://www.rubytapas.com/">RubyTapas</a> by Avdi Grimm. These guys have pioneered a business model that enables them to produce great content and make a living from it. I'm considering doing something similar.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-vimcasts-switched-to-a-paid-subscription">What if Vimcasts switched to a paid subscription?</h3>

<p>You could subscribe for a monthly fee of around $10, which would enable you to watch new episodes of Vimcasts. I would produce somewhere between 2-4 episodes per month. (These numbers are speculative at the moment.) The 50 existing episodes would remain freely available. I would only charge money for new content.</p>

<p>To date, Vimcasts has largely focussed on <em>core Vim functionality</em>. I would like to shift the emphasis towards <em>how to customize Vim</em>. I would focus on Vimscript and how to write plugins that make Vim behave the way you want. Instead of shopping around for plugins, you'd learn to build your own lightsaber.</p>

<p>When I set out to write a book on Vim, I did some market research asking <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2010/10/vim-user-survey/">"what topic would you most like to see covered?"</a> (I <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2010/11/working-title-practical-vim/">summarized the feedback here</a>). The most popular request was for a guide to mastering the editor, so I wrote Practical Vim.</p>

<p>The topic of Vimscript and plugin authoring came a close second. Steve Losh's <a href="http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/">Learn Vimscript the Hard Way</a> provides a great introduction to the subject, but (as <a href="http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/56.html">the author himself says</a>) there's a lot more to cover. I'm ready to tackle the subject, if there's sufficient interest.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-vimcasts-doesnt-switch-to-a-paid-subscription">What if Vimcasts doesn't switch to a paid subscription?</h3>

<p>I'm still passionate about Vim and I've got plenty more material up my sleeve. I'll continue to publish occasional free episodes as my schedule allows. I may also produce some longer screencasts (30-60 minute duration) for one-off purchases.</p>

<p>But I'm quite keen on the option of offering a paid subscription for my video tutorials, even if the topic is not Vim-related. If I don't switch Vimcasts to a paid subscription model, perhaps I'll launch a screencast series on something else instead.</p>
