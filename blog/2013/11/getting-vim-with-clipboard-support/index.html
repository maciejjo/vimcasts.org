    <p>Many systems ship with a version of Vim that was compiled with the <code>-clipboard</code> feature disabled, which is a damned nuisance! Being able to <a href="http://vimcasts.org/e/58">access the system clipboard from Vim</a> is an essential feature. Let's look at a few ways of getting the <code>+clipboard</code> feature on OS X and Ubuntu.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="on-os-x">On OS X</h3>

<p>On OS X Mavericks, Apple ships Vim version 7.3 with <code>-clipboard</code>. Here's the gist from running <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7435463"><code>/usr/bin/vim --version</code> on Mavericks</a> (and <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7435281">the same on Mountain Lion</a>). Shame on you Apple!</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://brew.sh/">use Homebrew</a>, you can get Vim with <code>+clipboard</code> by running:</p>

<pre><code>brew install vim
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a gist from running <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7435520"><code>/usr/local/bin/vim --version</code></a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/downloads/list">download MacVim</a>. Look inside <code>/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS</code>, and you'll see that the app provides two binaries: <code>MacVim</code>, which launches the GUI, and <code>Vim</code>, which runs in the Terminal with the same feature set. Both versions include the <code>+clipboard</code> feature. Here's a gist from running <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7435538"><code>/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim --version</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="on-linux">On Linux</h3>

<p>On desktop Linux systems the clipboard is handled by the X window system. Most systems that use X11 will ship a version of Vim with the <code>+clipboard</code> feature. If your desktop Linux distribution ships with Vim without the <code>+clipboard</code> feature, you should be able to install a Vim package that provides this feature, e.g. each of these packages for Ubuntu provides Vim with <code>+clipboard</code>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7436451">vim-gnome</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7436569">vim-athena</a>, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7436647">vim-gtx</a>.</p>

<p>Robin Skahjem-Eriksen wrote to me with a tip: you can run GVim inside the terminal by launching it with the <code>gvim -v</code> command. That could be handy if your distribution ship <code>vim</code> with <code>-clipboard</code>, but also ships <code>gvim</code> with <code>+clipboard</code>.</p>

<p>When Linux runs on a server it doesn't usually include X11. In this environment, it makes sense for Vim to be built with the <code>-clipboard</code> feature disabled. Some Vim packages are intended for systems without X11, such as the <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7436756"><code>vim-nox</code></a> package. It's possible to install packages on a Linux server that would add the <code>+clipboard</code> feature for Vim, but doing so would also install X11 and all its dependencies. That's probably not a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-fix-this">Can we fix this?</h3>

<p>Being able to <a href="http://vimcasts.org/e/58">access the system clipboard from Vim</a> is essential. It's a nuisance that some desktop systems ship Vim without the <code>+clipboard</code> feature! I'd like to see that change. Please make the information in this article obsolete by campaigning to have <code>+clipboard</code> enabled by default on your system.</p>

<p><em>Update: I've revised this article, because my understanding of Linux was terribly flawed. You can find the <a href="https://gist.github.com/nelstrom/7475980">original draft here</a>. Thanks to Will Gray for his patient explanations.</em></p>
