    <p>I sometimes get asked what software I use to reveal the Vim keystrokes in my video tutorials here on Vimcasts.org. The fact is that I add them by hand in post-production. It's not fun!</p>

<p>When I run my <a href="http://vimcasts.org/classes/core-vim">Core Vim Masterclasses</a> I use <a href="https://github.com/sdeken/keycastr/">Keycastr</a> to show what I'm doing in realtime. Keycastr uses Growl-style notifications to show all keystrokes across all applications, including every letter I type while communicating in a chat room, for example. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing! I would love to have <em>a dedicated program for visualizing my keystrokes in Vim</em>, so I've started building <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/vimprint">Vimprint</a> to scratch that itch.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="my-wishlist-for-vimprint">My wishlist for Vimprint</h3>

<p>My goal is to make Vimprint show all Vim keystrokes in realtime, so that I can use it when teaching Vim. In addition to showing which keystrokes were pressed, I'd like Vimprint to be able to give a bit of extra context: what does each command do, and from which mode was it triggered? Ultimately, I'd like Vimprint to handle all of Vim's built-in functionality, and for it to be extensible so that it can be made to understand commands supplied by popular plugins such as <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">surround.vim</a>.</p>

<p>I gave a presentation on Vimprint at this month's VimLondon meetup. You can watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/67215273">video on Vimeo</a> and refer to the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/nelstrom/vimprint-a-vim-keystroke-parser">slides on speakerdeck</a>.</p>

<h3 id="similar-projects">Similar projects</h3>

<p>In researching this topic, I've come across a few similar projects that have influenced or inspired me. (Let me know if I missed any.) <a href="https://github.com/AshleyF/VimSpeak">VimSpeak</a> by AshleyF turns spoken English into keystrokes. Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy84TYvXJbk">this demo</a>, where the author completes a VimGolf challenge by talking to his computer. It's awesome!</p>

<p>Turning English into keystrokes is the opposite of what I want to do. I want to turn keystrokes into plain English descriptions, and <a href="https://github.com/pafcu/Vimsplain">Vimsplain</a> by pafcu is a project that does exactly that. Vimsplain is run as a batch job at the command-line. That's cool! But I want to get these kinds of explanations in realtime.</p>

<p>George Brocklehurst from thoughtbot has achieved that with <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/vimulator">Vimulator</a>, which is a Vim Simulator (as the name suggests) that runs inside the browser. I love the way that Vimulator renders and explains keystrokes, but the task of implementing Vim in JavaScript I find daunting.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/vimgolf">VimGolf client</a> tracks your keystrokes, and sends them to <a href="http://www.vimgolf.com/">vimgolf.com</a>. It does this by launching Vim with the <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/starting.html#-w"><code>-w {scriptout}</code></a> option, which logs all keystrokes to the specified <code>{scriptout}</code> file.</p>

<p>That seems like a good starting point, but there's a problem with the <code>-w {scriptout}</code> option: it only writes keystrokes to the specified file when Vim exits. To create a realtime visualization, I would need a realtime stream of keystrokes.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kana">Kana Natsuno</a> (one of my Vim heroes) came up with this <a href="https://gist.github.com/kana/4202311">single-line patch</a>, which disables buffering of the <code>-w</code> option. With a custom build of Vim using my <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/macvim/commit/c65e7e650b806682152681c58078d29cb1904bfe">live-stream-keystrokes</a> branch of MacVim, I can get the realtime stream of keystrokes that I need. Sweet! Now I just need to parse it.</p>

<h3 id="parsing-vim-keystrokes-with-ragel">Parsing Vim keystrokes with Ragel</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.complang.org/ragel/">Ragel</a> is a <em>state machine compiler</em>, which seems like a good fit for this problem. After all, Vim itself is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite state machine</a> of sorts.</p>

<p>As a demonstration, I've created a <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/vimprint/blob/9ad2faca4001bf6cc1282c2cb0a245f08d06422c/lib/ragel/simple.rl"><code>simple.rl</code></a> ragel program that parses a tiny subset of Vim's commands. Install ragel (<code>brew install ragel</code> on a mac), then you can compile and run this program:</p>

<pre><code>ragel -R simple.rl
ruby simple.rb
</code></pre>

<p>As well as compiling executable Ruby code, Ragel can generate <code>.dot</code> graphs, which can be viewed using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>. Here's the state chart visualization of the <code>simple.rl</code> program (created with the command <code>ragel -Vp simple.rl</code>):</p>

<p><img src="http://vimcasts.org/images/blog/simple_state_transitions-large.png" width="480" height="333" alt="simple Vim state machine" /></p>

<p>I've found this kind of visualization to be very helpful in debugging Ragel programs.</p>

<h3 id="contributions-welcome">Contributions welcome</h3>

<p>This is an ambitious project. I'd welcome any help on it that I can get. If you'd like to <a href="http://www.pairprogramwith.me/">#pairwithme</a> on Vimprint, then <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#100;&#114;&#101;&#119;&#064;&#118;&#105;&#109;&#099;&#097;&#115;&#116;&#115;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">please get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>I'll be presenting a session on <em>Modelling State Machines with Ragel</em> at <a href="http://2013.eurucamp.org/speakers">Eurucamp</a> this year. I'd love to be able to demonstrate Vimprint in action by that date.</p>
