        <p>One year ago today, <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a> was released as a beta book. I'm thrilled with how the book has been received and I'd like to thank everybody who has purchased a copy. After a year of sales, I'm happy to report that Practical Vim is a best-seller!</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'll cut straight to the numbers. To date, we've sold a total of 9611 copies. That breaks down as 6347 ebooks and 3264 paperbacks (roughly 2 to 1). The ebook figure is bang up to date, but the true number of paperbacks sold is higher. That data comes in from Amazon and other vendors with a delay of a month or two. I'd hoped to sell 10k copies of Practical Vim in its first year. I thought that was an ambitious target, but it turns out to have been a good guess!</p>

<p>The Pragmatic Bookshelf offer a great deal for their authors: I get 50% of the profits from each sale. The combined total from my 4 royalty cheques so far is $68,978. That averages out at roughly $7 in my pocket for each sale. I get considerably less than that for each sale made through Amazon, but I get more than that for each direct sale through Pragmatic Bookshelf. Thanks again to those of you who bought from my publisher.</p>

<p>From start to finish, it took me 18 months to complete the book. I was working on other things as well during most of that time, but I was able to work full time on the book for several months. When I set out to write the book, I estimated that it would take me 4 months. Writing a book is harder than I expected!</p>

<p>Each month, the <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines">PragPub magazine</a> issues a list of what's hot in the Pragmatic Bookshelf catalog. Since Practical Vim was released, it has never left the top 10! Practical Vim was <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-05/choice-bits">#1 in April</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-06/choice-bits">#2 in May</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-07/choice-bits">#4 in June</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-08/choice-bits">#4 in July</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-09/choice-bits">#7 in August</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-10/choice-bits">#3 in September</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-11/choice-bits">#1 in October</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-12/choice-bits">#2 in November</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-01/choice-bits">#5 in December</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-02/choice-bits">#9 in January</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-03/choice-bits">#8 in February</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-04/bookshelf">#7 in March</a>. The two occasions when Practical Vim hit the number #1 spot followed the announcements of <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/newsletters/2012-04-18.html">the beta release</a> on 18 April 2012 and <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/newsletters/2012-09-26.html">the final release</a> on 26 September 2012.</p>

<h3 id="critical-acclaim">Critical acclaim</h3>

<p>The reviews of Practical Vim have been terrific. Linux Format Magazine <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2012/10/practical-vim-in-linux-format-magazine/">rated it 9/10</a>. To date, Practical Vim has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/product-reviews/1934356980">32 reviews on Amazon.com</a> as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/product-reviews/1934356980/">7 reviews on the UK version of the site</a>. 5 stars!</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve read Practical Vim, please take a moment to review it on Amazon. It really makes a difference. As <a href="https://twitter.com/jaulin/status/293350924896849921">Johan Aulin said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decided I want a Vim book for my birthday. Based on Amazon reviews, I settled on Practical Vim by @nelstrom as the best choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm so grateful to all of you who have reviewed my book or recommended it by word of mouth. Thanks again.</p>
