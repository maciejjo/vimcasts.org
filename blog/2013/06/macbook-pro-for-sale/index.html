    <p>I have a 15" MacBook Pro for sale. It's a 2010 model, with upgraded RAM and SSD. Here are the tech specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>15" screen</li>
  <li>2.4GHz Intel Core i5 processor</li>

<p><strong>UPDATE (8 July, 2013) - this MBP has sold already.</strong></p>

<p>The operating system is licensed to me (not to the machine), so you'll have to purchase your own Mountain Lion license for £14.</p>

<p>I purchased this MacBook Pro in April of 2010. It came with 4GB of RAM, and a 320GB hard disk drive. In November 2012, I upgraded to 8GB of RAM, and replaced the hard disk with a solid state drive (SSD). The SSD is smaller than the old hard disk, but it performs much better. These upgrades have given the machine a new lease of life.</p>

<p>I've replaced the standard feet on the bottom casing with Sugru-molded rubber feet, as described by <a href="http://sugru.com/guides/replace-macbook-s-rubber-feet">this article</a>. Also, there's a Vimcasts sticker on the lid. I'd like to leave that on as a memento to the fact that this is the machine I used to write <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>.</p>
