    <p>I'm going to run a series of Vim workshops in 2012. If you would like to attend, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/geHtT">sign up to the Vimcasts workshops mailing list</a>, and tell me where you live. If there is enough interest for your town, then I'll try and schedule it into my tour.</p>

<p>What can you expect from a Vimcasts workshop? Dirty hands. We learn best by doing, so I won't lecture you. Instead, we'll work through excercises designed to reveal the best practices of working with Vim. The material will tie in with my upcoming book, <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2010/11/working-title-practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>.</p>

<p>I need help. Can you recommend a suitable venue in your town? Are there any local meetups or user groups that might be interested in a Vim workshop? If you can host an event, or help me connect with the right audience, then I would love to hear from you. Please get in touch with drew@vimcasts.org.</p>

<p>I'll be visiting Austin TX later this month, to speak at <a href="http://sencha.com/senchacon2011">SenchaCon</a>. I'd love to run a Vim workshop while I'm out there. I'm available on the 27th and 28th of October. If you can help make it happen, please get in touch. And of course, <a href="http://eepurl.com/geHtT">sign up to the mailing list</a>.</p>
