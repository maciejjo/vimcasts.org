    <p>I could never find a light colorscheme for Vim that I enjoyed using, so I finally took the time to port the "Mac Classic" theme from TextMate. The <a href="http://github.com/nelstrom/vim-mac-classic-theme">source code is on gitub</a>, so feel free to fork it.</p>

<p></p>

</a></p>

<p>While making this colorscheme, I learned of a few useful tools. To get started, I used Marcin Kulik's <a href="http://coloration.sickill.net/">Coloration</a> tool, to convert the TextMate theme into a Vim colorscheme. The result looked pretty good for syntax elements, but the colors for Vim's interface needed some heavy tweaking.</p>

<p>I discovered Yuri Feldman's <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2937">hexHighlight.vim script</a>, which detects hex codes, and highlights them with the color that they represent.</p>

<p>To begin with, I just created the "Mac Classic" theme to work in GVim, but <a href="http://twitter.com/claytron/status/25113763230">people started asking if I was planning on making it work in color terminals</a>. That was when I recalled that Shawn Biddle had created <a href="http://shawncplus.github.com/Vim-toCterm/">a script for converting GUI colorschemes to work in color terminals</a>. I ran the "Mac Classic" theme through Shawn's script, and was pleased with the results.</p>

<p>My latest screencast on <a href="/e/25">creating colorschemes for Vim</a> goes into more detail on how I used each of these tools.</p>
