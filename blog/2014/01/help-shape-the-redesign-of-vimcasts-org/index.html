    <p>Vimcasts was launched four years ago, in January 2010. I anticipated making only a dozen screencasts, but there are now over 50, as well as a blog. I'm going to make some changes so you can find what you're looking for more easily. I'd appreciate your help! Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BT-6eVqTbsk6XmE2xzJHzNDHyTJArgYb-L9BTRLZGY0/viewform">fill out this survey</a> and I'll take your feedback on board.</p>
