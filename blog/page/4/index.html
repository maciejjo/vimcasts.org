    <h2><a href="/blog/2013/02/habit-breaking-habit-making/">Habit breaking, habit making</a></h2>
    <time datetime="2013-02-06">Feb 06, 2013</time>

    <p>Moving your Vim cursor around using the arrow keys is a bad habit, and like many bad habits it's a difficult one to break! Putting these lines into your vimrc can help:</p>

<pre><code>noremap &lt;Up&gt; &lt;NOP&gt;
noremap &lt;Down&gt; &lt;NOP&gt;
noremap &lt;Left&gt; &lt;NOP&gt;
noremap &lt;Right&gt; &lt;NOP&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet causes each of the arrow keys to execute <em>no operation</em>, or in other words: it disables them. Next time you move your hand to the arrow keys you'll find that nothing happens when you press them. That should remind you to move your hand back where it belongs: on the home row, where <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, and <code>l</code> keys are waiting for you. Alternatively, you could use the <a href="http://www.tylercipriani.com/vim.html">konami code</a> version of this snippet.</p>

<p>Learning to operate Vim without leaving the home row is the first rite of passage. If you're still in the habit of moving around using the arrow keys, then you should disable them today.</p>

    <time datetime="2013-01-02">Jan 02, 2013</time>

    <p>Do you avoid using Vim's split windows because they're confusing? That might be a problem of your own devising. If you've bolted a project drawer onto Vim, then you've added unnecessary complexity to Vim's otherwise minimal interface. Split windows and the project drawer go together like oil and vinegar. I don't mean to say that you can combine them to create a delicious salad dressing. I mean that they don't mix well!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2012/11/oredev-presentation-vim-precision-editing-at-the-speed-of-thought/">ÃËredev presentation: Vim - precision editing at the speed of thought</a></h2>
    <time datetime="2012-11-12">Nov 12, 2012</time>

    <p>Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://oredev.org/">Ã˜redev</a>, in Sweden. Video from my session, <a href="https://vimeo.com/53144573">Vim - Precision editing at the speed of thought</a> can be found on Vimeo. You can view <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/nelstrom/vim-precision-editing-at-the-speed-of-thought">the slides from my talk</a> on speakerdeck. Here's the synopsis from my talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vim's modal editing model was conceived to meet the constraints of computing in the 1970s. The arrival of the mouse made intuitive point-and-click user interfaces the norm. While this was a boon for the novice computer user, it was a backward step for the power user. For a touch typist, there is no quicker way of editing text than with the keyboard.</p>

  <p>This session won't teach you much in the way of practical hands-on advice - for that, see my <a href="http://oredev.org/2012/sessions/vim-masterclass">Vim masterclass</a>. Instead, it will challenge your preconceptions about Vim, and inspire you to give it a second look. We'll draw analogies with the mechanics of video games such as Quake and Street Fighter II. We'll look at patterns in the game of chess, and see how they relate to the task of editing text. And we'll learn what Vim users have in common with Scrabble players.</p>
