    <time datetime="2012-10-25">Oct 25, 2012</time>

    <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/">Vim London</a> is back!</p>

<p>Yesterday, without warning, Meetup.com deleted the Vim London group. In their words, here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your Meetup Group, Vim London, was brought to our attention as specifically promoting a product, which is not in compliance with our Terms of Service. Meetup is a community website and not a commercial marketplace… As a result of our inquiry, we've closed your Meetup Group and refunded your Organizer Dues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In their generic message, they don't indicate which product was apparently being promoted. The meetup group that we created has vanished, along with our list of members. That means I can't contact our (already 50+) members to explain what's happened, so I'm announcing it here.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2012/10/amazon-reviews-of-practical-vim/">Amazon reviews of Practical Vim</a></h2>
    <time datetime="2012-10-12">Oct 12, 2012</time>

    <p>The first five-star <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Edit-Speed-Thought/product-reviews/1934356980/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1">reviews for Practical Vim</a> have cropped up, and I'm blushing after reading them. It's been described as <em>the book Vim has always deserved</em>, and <em>a must-have for anybody who types</em>. Here are a few choice phrases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is one of the best technical books I've ever read: comprehensive but never dry.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PEKYDZMZ7HH/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1934356980&amp;amp;linkCode=&amp;amp;nodeID=&amp;amp;tag=">Peter</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. …Satisfaction guaranteed.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VV7TYQKRMB4E/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1934356980&amp;amp;linkCode=&amp;amp;nodeID=&amp;amp;tag=">iynaix</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you've read Practical Vim, please write a five-star review on Amazon. It makes a real difference. On the day that the first reviews were written, Practical Vim jumped from #16 to #2 on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3849/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_4_last">Amazon best-seller list for the Linux category</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm happy to announce that the paperback edition of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a> is now available. If you've pre-ordered, then your copy should arrive soon. Also, that means Practical Vim is no longer in <em>beta</em>. It's been tech-reviewed, indexed, edited, typeset, and laid out. If you've been holding out for the final cut, then your wait is over. </p>

    <p>I'm sorry to say that I'm unable to take my <a href="/blog/2012/05/on-tour-this-summer-vim-masterclass-workshop/">workshops on tour around the US this summer</a>. I'm not allowed to work there on a business/tourist visa, and I was too disorganized to obtain the visa that would permit me to work. It's a shame, because I had set the months of August-September aside for this tour!</p>

    <time datetime="2012-08-06">Aug 06, 2012</time>

    <p>Vim users sit somewhere on a spectrum, based on how much they customize their editor. At one end of the spectrum, there are those who use Vim with no customizations whatsoever. At the other end are those who customize Vim to the point where it barely resembles the stock install.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Gary Bernhardt</a> advocates using stock Vim, with very few customizations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vim is a chainsaw, and the last thing you want on a chainsaw is controls that are not the controls you're used to, because then you will cut your hand off.<br />
Gary Bernhardt on <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/040-rr-text-editors-and-ides/">Ruby Rogues episode 40</a> (17:35)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gary's chainsaw metaphor warns against the practice of over-customizing Vim. But I would also warn against using Vim without any customizations. Vim is highly configurable, and some of the default settings are suboptimal. If you don't have a basic vimrc, then you're putting up with inconveniences that were fixed decades ago.</p>
