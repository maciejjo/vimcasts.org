    <h2><a href="/blog/2012/11/oredev-presentation-vim-precision-editing-at-the-speed-of-thought/">ÃËredev presentation: Vim - precision editing at the speed of thought</a></h2>
    <time datetime="2012-11-12">Nov 12, 2012</time>

    <p>Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://oredev.org/">Ã˜redev</a>, in Sweden. Video from my session, <a href="https://vimeo.com/53144573">Vim - Precision editing at the speed of thought</a> can be found on Vimeo. You can view <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/nelstrom/vim-precision-editing-at-the-speed-of-thought">the slides from my talk</a> on speakerdeck. Here's the synopsis from my talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vim's modal editing model was conceived to meet the constraints of computing in the 1970s. The arrival of the mouse made intuitive point-and-click user interfaces the norm. While this was a boon for the novice computer user, it was a backward step for the power user. For a touch typist, there is no quicker way of editing text than with the keyboard.</p>

  <p>This session won't teach you much in the way of practical hands-on advice - for that, see my <a href="http://oredev.org/2012/sessions/vim-masterclass">Vim masterclass</a>. Instead, it will challenge your preconceptions about Vim, and inspire you to give it a second look. We'll draw analogies with the mechanics of video games such as Quake and Street Fighter II. We'll look at patterns in the game of chess, and see how they relate to the task of editing text. And we'll learn what Vim users have in common with Scrabble players.</p>

    <time datetime="2012-10-25">Oct 25, 2012</time>

    <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/">Vim London</a> is back!</p>

<p>Yesterday, without warning, Meetup.com deleted the Vim London group. In their words, here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your Meetup Group, Vim London, was brought to our attention as specifically promoting a product, which is not in compliance with our Terms of Service. Meetup is a community website and not a commercial marketplace… As a result of our inquiry, we've closed your Meetup Group and refunded your Organizer Dues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In their generic message, they don't indicate which product was apparently being promoted. The meetup group that we created has vanished, along with our list of members. That means I can't contact our (already 50+) members to explain what's happened, so I'm announcing it here.</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2012/10/amazon-reviews-of-practical-vim/">Amazon reviews of Practical Vim</a></h2>
    <time datetime="2012-10-12">Oct 12, 2012</time>

    <p>The first five-star <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Edit-Speed-Thought/product-reviews/1934356980/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1">reviews for Practical Vim</a> have cropped up, and I'm blushing after reading them. It's been described as <em>the book Vim has always deserved</em>, and <em>a must-have for anybody who types</em>. Here are a few choice phrases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is one of the best technical books I've ever read: comprehensive but never dry.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PEKYDZMZ7HH/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1934356980&amp;amp;linkCode=&amp;amp;nodeID=&amp;amp;tag=">Peter</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. …Satisfaction guaranteed.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VV7TYQKRMB4E/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1934356980&amp;amp;linkCode=&amp;amp;nodeID=&amp;amp;tag=">iynaix</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you've read Practical Vim, please write a five-star review on Amazon. It makes a real difference. On the day that the first reviews were written, Practical Vim jumped from #16 to #2 on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3849/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_4_last">Amazon best-seller list for the Linux category</a>.</p>
