    <p>I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be running a <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/vim-masterclass">Vim masterclass at Strange Loop</a>, in September this year.

<p>Closer to home (for me anyway), I'll also be running a <a href="http://vimcasts.eventbrite.com">Vim Masterclass in Berlin</a> on April 20th, at LAUNCH/CO.</p>

    <p>You've already worked your way through the <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_01.html#tutor">Vimtutor</a>, right? I've prepared a series of lessons that follow a similar format: plain text files containing simple problems, with instructions on how to complete them. The tasks are carefully designed to demonstrate tips and tricks that will boost your productivity. We'll work through them as a class, but you can take them at your own pace.</p>

    <time datetime="2011-10-05">Oct 05, 2011</time>

    <p>I'm going to run a series of Vim workshops in 2012. If you would like to attend, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/geHtT">sign up to the Vimcasts workshops mailing list</a>, and tell me where you live. If there is enough interest for your town, then I'll try and schedule it into my tour.</p>

<p>What can you expect from a Vimcasts workshop? Dirty hands. We learn best by doing, so I won't lecture you. Instead, we'll work through excercises designed to reveal the best practices of working with Vim. The material will tie in with my upcoming book, <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2010/11/working-title-practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Fugitive.vim: a git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal.</em> That's how Tim Pope describes his git plugin for Vim. I've had <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2975">fugitive.vim</a> installed since it was released, but until recently I never took the time to figure out what was <em>so awesome</em> that could make it illegal.</p>

    <p>Ever since learning about Vim's <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#text-objects">text-objects</a> I have wished that there was a way of selecting blocks in ruby code. Well, now there is. Today I am releasing a plugin that creates <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3382">a custom text object for selecting ruby blocks</a>. Merry Christmas!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/2010/11/arrrrcamp-presentation-vim---walking-without-crutches/">ArrrrCamp presentation: Vim - walking without crutches</a></h2>
    <time datetime="2010-11-01">Nov 01, 2010</time>

    <p>Last week, I gave a presentation at <a href="http://arrrrcamp.be/">ArrrrCamp</a> called <em>Vim - walking without crutches</em>. You can now <a href="http://old.arrrrcamp.be/videos/vim-walking-without-crutches">watch the video</a> on their website. Here's the synopsis for my talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his provocatively titled blog post <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">"Everyone Who Tried to Convince Me to use Vim was Wrong"</a>, Yehuda Katz showed how he switched from TextMate to Vim without experiencing an initial dip in productivity. Begin by emulating the working environment that you are comfortable with, then adopt Vims idioms as and when you discover them. This is a welcome alternative to the hazing "do everything the Vim way from day 1" approach, which is widely advocated by veterans. Anything that offers a leg-up Vims infamous learning curve is to be commended. But be careful not to get too comfortable. Mastering Vim requires a change in mindset and if you don't break some of your old habits you could miss out.</p>

  <p>I will begin by showing how a TextMate user can make Vim feel almost like home. I will show what preferences you can set in your vimrc file, and which plugins you can install to emulate the TextMate experience. Like walking with crutches, some of these features are useful while you build your strength, but if you can learn to walk without them you will be able to move faster. I will show how.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that you have to have Silverlight installed to watch the video. A <a href="http://twitter.com/sabiddle/statuses/29376586331">few</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/paraseba/statuses/29384741780">people</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/peteraronoff/statuses/29386426740">Twitter</a> have <a href="http://twitter.com/bwinton/statuses/29388224325">asked</a> if it will be made available in another format. The organisers said that <a href="http://twitter.com/arrrrcamp/status/29306852110">"it was this or no videos at all"</a>, so you can like it or lump it.</p>

    <time datetime="2010-11-01">Nov 01, 2010</time>

    <p>I am very pleased to announce that the <a href="http://pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> will be publishing my book on Vim. The working title is <em>Practical Vim</em>, and I hope to complete it by the spring of 2011. Here is a synopsis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For an open source project Vim’s documentation is impressive in scope, but there is still a considerable barrier between the novice and the productive Vim user. Whereas it is possible to improve as a programmer or writer by reading other people’s code, poetry or prose, there are fewer opportunities to learn how to use an editor effectively. Vim’s documentation reads like a dictionary; I propose to write a phrasebook.</p>
