    <time datetime="2013-09-13">Sep 13, 2013</time>

    <p>I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my recent survey about supporting Vimcasts via a subscription model. I've taken your feedback on board and have decided to keep producing free Vimcasts. I can cover this site's running costs and support myself by teaching Vim classes and producing longer video tutorials to sell.</p>

    <time datetime="2013-05-30">May 30, 2013</time>

    <p>I sometimes get asked what software I use to reveal the Vim keystrokes in my video tutorials here on Vimcasts.org. The fact is that I add them by hand in post-production. It's not fun!</p>

<p>When I run my <a href="http://vimcasts.org/classes/core-vim">Core Vim Masterclasses</a> I use <a href="https://github.com/sdeken/keycastr/">Keycastr</a> to show what I'm doing in realtime. Keycastr uses Growl-style notifications to show all keystrokes across all applications, including every letter I type while communicating in a chat room, for example. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing! I would love to have <em>a dedicated program for visualizing my keystrokes in Vim</em>, so I've started building <a href="https://github.com/nelstrom/vimprint">Vimprint</a> to scratch that itch.</p>
